## 📁 Project Structure
- `heat_surface.py` – Solves the heat equation parameterized by surface power distributions.
- `heat_volumetric.py` – Solves the heat equation parameterized by volumetric power distributions.
- `hybrid_solver.ipynb` – Hybrid solver combining operator learning model and tnaditional numerical method (GMRES).
- `train.py`, `models.py` – Core model definition and training scripts.
- `eval.py` – Evaluation utilities.
